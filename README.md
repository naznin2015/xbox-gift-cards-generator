What are Xbox Gift Cards?
An Xbox gift card is a prepaid card that can be used to purchase content and services from the Xbox Store, which includes digital games, in-game purchases, downloadable content (DLC), movies, and more. The value of an Xbox gift card typically ranges from $10 to $100, though amounts can vary depending on the retailer and region. These cards are available in both physical and digital formats.

How Do Xbox Gift Cards Work?
To redeem an Xbox gift card, users simply need to enter the code found on the card into their Xbox console or Microsoft account. The balance is then added to their account, which can be used to purchase games, subscriptions like Xbox Game Pass, Xbox Live Gold, and other digital media.

Physical Xbox Gift Cards: These cards are sold in stores or online, often in the form of a plastic card. The card will have a unique code on the back that the recipient can scratch off to reveal the code.

Digital Xbox Gift Cards: These are delivered via email or available for immediate download after purchase online. They provide the same function as physical cards, except the code is delivered electronically.

What Can You Buy with Xbox Gift Cards?
The flexibility of Xbox gift cards makes them extremely popular. Here are some of the things that can be purchased with an Xbox gift card:

Digital Games: Xbox gift cards can be used to buy any digital game available on the Xbox Store. From AAA titles to indie games, there's something for every type of gamer.

In-Game Purchases: For those who enjoy mobile games, MMOs, or live-service titles like Fortnite, Apex Legends, and Minecraft, Xbox gift cards can be used to purchase in-game currency, skins, weapons, and other items.

Game Pass and Subscriptions: Xbox Game Pass, Xbox Live Gold, and Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscriptions are all available for purchase using gift cards. These services offer access to a vast library of games and online multiplayer features.

Movies and TV Shows: Beyond gaming, Xbox gift cards can be used to buy movies or TV shows through the Microsoft Store.
